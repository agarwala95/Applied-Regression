```{r}
library("readr", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.4")
library("ggplot2", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.4")
weightloss <- read_csv("C:/Users/MAX/TUM/Applied Regression/weightloss.csv",col_names=TRUE)
ggplot(weightloss,aes(Before,Loss))+geom_point()+labs(x="Before",y="Loss")
model<-lsfit(weightloss$Before,weightloss$Loss)
summary(model)
```

The diagonal elements of the Hat matrix are given by:
```{r}
H<-ls.diag(model)$hat
h_bar<-mean(H)
high_leverage<-H>2*h_bar
ggplot(weightloss, aes(x=Before, y=Loss)) + geom_point(aes(color=high_leverage))
```

This method does not catch all the outliers as the point(275,51) is not identified as an outlier.
